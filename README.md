# 🚀 15-30 Days DSA Roadmap to Crack ₹10–15 LPA Offers

### (Core Topics for Quick Mastery + Optional Advanced Concepts for Long-Term Dream Companies Preparation)

This roadmap helps you crack ₹10–15 LPA roles efficiently in 15-30 days by focusing on high-impact core DSA topics.
For those aiming higher and with more time, Tier 4 covers advanced data structures and algorithms for cracking top-tier dream companies — which may take 3-4 months to master.

## 🧠 Time & Space Complexity Primer
### Before jumping into Tier 1, understand the Big-O complexities of key operations. Most interviews expect you to:
- Know the worst-case time complexity of standard algorithms
- Choose optimal solutions (avoid O(n²) when O(n log n) is possible)
- Understand space-time tradeoffs (e.g., using extra space for faster results)
